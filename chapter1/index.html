    <p>one of my favorite beverages is a caramel iced coffee. I like it b ecause it has the perfect balance of sweetness and bold coffee flavor. The caramel adds a smooth, rich taste that makes it enjoyable without being too overpowering. I usually prefer it with oat milk since it gives it a creamy texture. It is my go-to drink when I need an energy boost while working on homework or coding projects.
